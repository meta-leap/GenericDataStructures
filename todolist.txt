Additional Data Structure:
  ☐ Sorted Set @low
  ☐ Binary Heap @high
  ☐ Fibonacci Heap @low
  ☐ Trie @low
  ☐ Linked List @critical
  ☐ Pair @low

Extra Utilities:
  ☐ [generic_map.h] map (create and init)_capacity functions

Bugs:
  ☐ [generic_iterators/trie_iterator.h] Trie iterator tries to return the same value twice in a row sometimes. Currently works with bandaid.
