Additional Data Structure:
  ☐ Set @critical
  ☐ Sorted Set @low
  ☐ Binary Heap @high
  ☐ Fibonacci Heap @low
  ☐ Trie @low
  ☐ Linked List @critical
  ☐ Collection Iterators @high
  ☐ Grid @low
  ☐ Pair @low

Extra Utilities:
  ☐ create and destroy functions - These will allocate and free the actual data structures themselves, not just the fields. @high
  ☐ map - remove_and_free function - A function that passes the specified key and value to a function pointer that handles freeing their memory @high
